## Password Generator
*This is a simple JavaScript-based password generator that creates random passwords based on a user-defined length. The generated passwords include a combination of the following character types:

Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Numbers (0-9)
Symbols (!@#$%^&*()_+[]{}|;:,.<>?)
How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the password-generator.js file.

Open the password-generator.js file in a text editor.

Run the script by opening it in a web browser or using a JavaScript runtime environment like Node.js.

The script will prompt you to enter the desired password length. Enter a whole number (e.g., 12) and press Enter.

The script will generate a random password of the specified length and display it in the console.

You can use the generated password for your security needs.

Customization
You can customize the character sets used for generating passwords by modifying the uppercaseChars, lowercaseChars, numberChars, and symbolChars variables in the script. For example, you can add or remove symbols as needed.
